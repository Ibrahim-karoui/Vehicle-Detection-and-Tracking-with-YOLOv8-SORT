# Vehicle Detection and Tracking with YOLOv8 + SORT

This project detects and tracks vehicles in a video using **YOLOv8** for object detection and **SORT** for tracking.  
It is **Part 1** of a larger project and will be followed by:
- **Part 2**: License plate detection and OCR recognition.  
- **Part 3**: An improved version using **DeepSORT** for more robust tracking.  

## Features
- Detects vehicles (cars, motorcycles, buses, trucks)
- Tracks each vehicle with a unique ID across frames
- Saves the processed video with bounding boxes and IDs

## Requirements
Make sure to install the dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Data Preparation
- Download the video from: https://www.pexels.com/download/video/2103099/
- Place the downloaded video in the `data` folder.
Note: The video files are not included in the repository due to large file size.

## Results
The resulting video has been removed from the `results` folder due to its large size, but here is a screenshot from the video.
